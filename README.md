# Cultivate Happy
A simple mood and gratitude journal that helps slowly grow appreciation and overall happiness. The act of tracking positive thoughts and feelings for just three weeks can improve your overall mood and outlook.

A very fast prototype for mobile that's more proof of concept than working app at the moment.
